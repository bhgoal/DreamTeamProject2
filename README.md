## About
Potbuddy is a plant care information website where users may receive care and growth tips for a variety of plants, take a survey to see what type of plant may be right for them, and chat in real-time with other users.

It utilizes custom CSS and Handlebars for the front-end, and users may authenticate using Passport.js. Express and Node.js communicate with a MySQL database which stores user account information and chat messages.
